# ProXManagerHCI584

Version 2 Changes:
Added functionalities to select from a database of added clients. Added a seperate register page for manager to register a new client. Spotify API is being tested on the home page for both users to log in and connect their Spotify, but APIs are not as easy to work with as I had originally expected, and this will be a lot of trial and error.

Next updates will include login functionality to access users respective pages, Spotify login for clients, ability for clients to view their data and enter missing information, ability for client to receive alerts.
